# ElastiContent-Front

Hello there, my name is Paulo Henrique, responsible for Frontend Engineering at ElastiContent, and before talking about the project, I would to talk about the motivations that lead me  to start this project and keep working on it.

## Motivations
1. Project
2. Study
3. Hobby
4. Relationship
5. Contribution to the world

### 1 - Project
First of all the project itself caught all my atention, and the problem it solve is new, interesting and very focused.

### 2 - Study
Second, is was an excelent opportunity to use my skills, put in practice all my frontend knowledge and learn this things:
- React.js - I want to improve my knowledge on React, and a text Editor is a perfect scenario for React
- Typescript - I'm using this project to learn about Typescript in my own speed, then share what I learned with my team at work
- Jest - Improve my experience with Tests and best practices to TDD with React
- UX / UI / Acessibility - Not only the Layout should be clean, also components have to provide the accesibility and good User Experience, in this case in working alongside the design team to create components with this principles
- Design System - Both me and the Designer took this opportunity to put in practice all the concepts that involves what we call "Design System", thorugh reasearch we figured out that is much more than a "Style Guide".

### 3 - Hobby
This is very important to a side project, what makes me work on this a little every day? I indeed love technology, specially Frontend, and have the freedom to implement new things and ideas turn this into a Hobby very attractive. 

### 4 - Relationship
It happened that my future spouse is an amazing Designer (dri3lis.com), and responsible for the Design part in this project, I'm not over overestimating her, she passed thorugh a lot of versions before arriving this one, always thinking primarily on the final user, while working together with me to create smart components, and a Single Source of Truth, the result was an stunning clean platform, accessible, interactive and with high reusable components. For sure we had to read and learn a lot to achieve this, and we did it together, thus increase even more our relationship, I consider a blessing being able to work so close with her in things that we love to do, and we are putting our hearts on it

### 5 - Contribution to the world
We discovered the importance of having Enginering and Design speaking the same language and respecting each other to be very valuable, but In all the experience with previous jobs we had, and start with this in a project or in a company needs extra effort at the beginning, and we see that this extra effort lacks, most of the time because none of the parts can see visualize the benefits, we are working on how to show that benefit to the world



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
